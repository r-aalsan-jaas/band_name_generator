# Band Name Generator 

Welcome to the **Band Name Generator** â€“ a fun and simple Python project that helps users create a cool band name by answering just two questions!

## Project Description

This beginner-friendly project takes the user's input (the name of the city they grew up in and their pet's name) and combines them to generate a unique and quirky band name. It's a great way to get started with basic Python programming and working with user input.

## Features

- Simple command-line interface
- Uses Python's built-in `input()` function to interact with the user
- Dynamically generates a custom band name
- Perfect for learning variables and string concatenation

## Technologies Used

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)

### Follow the prompts:

1. **Enter the city you grew up in**
2. **Enter your pet's name**
3. **Get your band name!**

## Example Output

```text
Welcome to the Band Name Generator.
What's the name of the city you grew up in?
> Nashville
What's your pet's name?
> Luna
Your band name could be Nashville Luna
```

## Future Improvements

- Add random adjectives to spice up the names  
- Allow users to generate multiple band names  
- Add a web version using Flask or Django
